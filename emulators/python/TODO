document emulator usage

slow_in
    errormesg unknown char, convert to g15 hex before print

iosys.get_status
    should it return boolean Ready or the entire variable
        entire variable
    wait unitl ptr is fed through to iosys to decide.
    modify cmds.py:verify to use

eliminate qcmd

bkuker
    fractal program results different than in web emulator

button on
    readblock message.
    simplifiy?

intercom
    loading zero suppression

slowout
    TYPEOUT  if prior line did not end with \n, concatenate with prior line

attach GUI

cmp prompt
    needs double CR before displaying prompt.

on dissassembly
    add field to drum memory indicating which tape block was block of orgin
    when tape is copied into 19, label with origin tape block
    when a block copy is performed copying track to track (usually from 19)
        copy tape block id with it.
    when printing code disassembly during trace execution, add tape block prefix.

on block commands
    copies or AR+, add to dissassembly fields start and end times of the block.

TTR12:
    u 38,37,0,28,28  What does this one do.

cpu dc button off
    should terminate simuations, not just lock sim engine

typewriter
    add direct G15 command input
        done, need to debug/verify operation
    add alphanumeric modes

reduce checksum routines
    PTR has two
    drum has one
    subr has one.
        believe subr should be the golden one

can we eliminate int variable type
    use comp2s of known size (29 or 58)
    always add instead of subtract

profile code for speedup

replace int(x,0) with a g15 hex equivhhhhhhhhhhhhlent

verbose does not register with cmd interpreter unlike verbosity

cpu has hex converting routine
    have created another (not debugged in subr)
    pick one (is cpu only place where used)

add history to typewriter output
    list history to move to iosys

cpu children verbosity flags should point back to cpu module
    instead of during __init__ constructioon
    to allow dynamic setting
        or have cmd go to proper hardware hierarchy location

paragraph D61 return exit
    different results with compute sw in go or bp

need to add a CPU.close() at sim shutdown
    needs to call vtrace logger

really think through lock/unlock.
    we have commented out many of these.
    in new structure the handlers are in the secondary clock domain

int(x,0) bombs if given a non-numeric value
    ie user mistypes a user label

add run to halt/typein/typeout + 2 instructions
		pause
    magtape

enable emulator to be run from any directory
    include needs to check current directory, relative, and then the installation directory

status message
    convert hex IO Status/Ready to ascii messages

put dictionaries to convert user verbose requests to numeric

cpu:word29decode uses %x

g15logger, no sign, uses %x

cmd status looks for status and Status
	let's consolidate done to one or the other, but not both

debug/test pause command

=== backport to c++ model ++++

backport from python to c++, d31
    one bug fixed on 1/24 not in c++
        23:31ch3  add +1 to time_End (time_end is inclusive)
    
 test27, (move to Mz)
    has ch=2 and ch4 variants
    need to copy from python to c++

backport to c++ type19 condition test on ch==0
    needs to handle rollover past 108 with the correction of 20 in mind

backport to c++ return fix for unusual CHs
    return in general
   Paragraph C-12c
    TR/TVA not => block sign bit onto EB for certain tracks.
    not in c++ model either

Paragraph C-12c
    TR/TVA not => block sign bit onto EB for certain tracks.
    not in c++ model either

modify log trace output format to match python

==== verilog =====

Python/Verilog differences:
    need to check Verilog:
        instr 18 at wr 30: print AR
            coding manual (and python) clears AR
            while Verilog does not
        instr 26 at wrt 32,
        	repeatedly waiting for IOReady,   ACC begins to rotate left by four bits
            why?  not always, just sometimes.
            4-bit precess implies IO character arrived.
            but why does ACC precess?  shouldn't this be contained to iO-subsystem?


===== TTR =======

 TTR12 abnominallies
    two loaders on tape prior to TTR1
    ttr12 from PF and DG are different
    TTR1 0:19  T=20 in listing, T=21 in tape

=== futures ====

disassembler
    use dgreen's format, raw terms, followed by derived terms.
    add .s style output
