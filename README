Library of known g15 tapes

These tape images have been acquired from a variety of 
sources.  The "captured" tape images were in different 
formats and have different artifacts embedded in them.
They are converted to a ascii character tape image format (pti).
From the PTI format, a variety of formats are generated:

*.pti       Tape Image - Ascii format (master format)
*.ptir      raw tape image (as read without error checks)
*.ptw		29bit word (unsigned) format
*.pt		5 bit binary tape format (Suitable for punching onto a tape)
*.ptr		5bit binary, reversed - for punching a 8 track tape punch w 5 level tape
*.dis		Disassembler listing
*.sum		Checksum
*.v			Verilog Behavioral model (makes ROM from tape)


**********************

After cloning repository:

make		# first make creates tape_images directory and place *.pti files there
make		# second make creates derivative tape formats (described above)

To clean

make clean

The known quality of the tape images varies.

The dgreen tapes have been used in an emulator and intercom does work correctly.
The test routine tape from pf has been used in both a python emulator and in a Verilog FPGA.
the lcm tapes are the newest and diaper has been run through an emulator.
